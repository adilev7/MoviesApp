# MoviesApp

### Overview
The app displays different movies' informarmation taken from ["TMDB" API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs).  
When the app loads for the first time, it takes the user through TMDB's authentication that is needed in order to proceed.  
During the authentication process the user will be redirected to TMDB in order to login/signup to TMDB.  

### Usage
Once the user is authenticated they will be able to:  
- View the movies gallery  
- Mark a movie as 'Favorite'  
- Filter by Popular/Now Playing/Favorite movies  
- View each movie's details  
  
### Installation  
In order to get the app up and running write ```npm install``` in the terminal, followed by ```npm run dev```.  

### Configuration  
The app is currently for development purposes only, therefore all basic global app variables are currently held in a `constants.js` file.
